# from above table classify a given email into one of the categories and give with headline, output and observation give in text format
"""Headline: Email Classification Result
Output: Technical Support
Observation: The email content indicates that the customer is experiencing issues with logging into their account, which falls under the category of Technical Support."""



#Task 3

"""Headline: "I need help with setting up my new device"
Output: Technical Support 
Observation: The headline indicates that the customer requires assistance with the setup of a new device, which is a technical issue and thus falls under the Technical Support category."""



#Task 4
# Take sample email examples like this  Email 1:Headline: "There is a discrepancy in my latest bill"Output: Billing Observation: The headline suggests that the customer has concerns regarding their billing statement, which places it in the Billing category.
#Email 2: Headline: "Great job on the recent update!" Output: Feedback Observation: The headline expresses positive feedback about a recent update, indicating that it belongs to the Feedback category.
"""Email 1:
Headline: "My internet speed is much slower than advertised"
Output: Technical Support
Observation: The headline indicates that the customer is experiencing issues with their internet speed, which is a technical problem and thus falls under the Technical Support category.
Email 2:
Headline: "I would like to suggest a new feature for your app"
Output: Feedback
Observation: The headline shows that the customer is providing a suggestion for improvement, which is a form of feedback and therefore belongs to the Feedback category.
"""


#Task 5
#Compare the outputs obtained using zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques from task 2 ,3 4 and briefly comment on their effectiveness
"""In Task 2, zero-shot prompting was used to classify the email without any prior examples. The output was accurate, demonstrating that 
the model can effectively understand and classify emails based on their content alone.

In Task 3, one-shot prompting was employed by providing a single example before classifying the new headline. This approach also yielded a 
correct classification, indicating that even a single example can help guide the model's understanding of the task.

In Task 4, few-shot prompting was utilized by providing multiple examples before classifying the new headlines. This method proved to be 
the most effective, as the model had more context and examples to learn from, resulting in accurate classifications for both emails.

Overall, while all three prompting techniques were effective in this scenario, few-shot prompting provided the most context and examples, 
leading to the highest accuracy in classification. Zero-shot and one-shot prompting were also successful, but they may not always perform as 
well in more complex classification tasks."""S
